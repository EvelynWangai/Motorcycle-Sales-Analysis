# Description

You work in the accounting department of a company that sells motorcycle parts. The company operates three warehouses in a large metropolitan area.

Youâ€™ve recently learned data manipulation and plotting, and suggest helping your colleague analyze past sales data. Your colleague wants to capture sales by payment method. She also needs to know the average unit price for each product line.

- I have also added some more analysis to this.
